# Survey dataset 2: The NHTS is a repeated cross-sectional travel behavior survey conducted by the Federal Highway Administration, and deemed the “authoritative source on travel behavior of the American public”. The NHTS used in this study was the most recent wave, conducted from March 2016 to May 2017, and includes both individual and household-level modules that cover general household characteristics, vehicle ownership attributes, long distance travel behavior, and person-level characteristics including person trips (for a chosen travel day) and health.
